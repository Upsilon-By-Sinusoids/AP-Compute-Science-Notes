### Bollean oprations 

Boolean operations means operations which only have 2 answers either **True** or **False**. 

There are many Boolean operators through which we do boolean operations: 

+------------------+-----------------------+

+------------------+-----------------------+
|         >        |       More Than       |
+------------------+-----------------------+

+------------------+-----------------------+
|        !=        |      Not Equal to     |
